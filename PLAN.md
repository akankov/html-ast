# `akankov/html-ast` — Plan

> **Status:** planning only, not yet implemented. No code, no scaffolding.
> **Owner:** Aleksei Kankov (`akankov@gmail.com`).
> **Created:** 2026-05-06.
> **Sibling repos in this workspace:** `../html-min/`, `../twig-compress-html/`.

This document is the cold-start brief for the `akankov/html-ast` package. It is self-contained: a future session, or future-you in three months, should be able to read just this file and know why the package exists, what shape it should take, what is decided, and what is still open.

---

## 1. Strategic context

This package is **Tier A, Wave 2, Package #2** in the 12-month `akankov/*` ecosystem plan (see workspace strategy doc, "Building an akankov/* ecosystem: a 12-month visa-grade strategy"). The strategic frame:

- **Anchor for USCIS criterion #5** ("Original Contributions of Major Significance"). The pitch is that `html-ast` is **"`nikic/php-parser` for HTML"** — a platform play with no PHP precedent. Once 5+ other libraries depend on it, citation-by-other-projects becomes the visa evidence: every dependent package compounds the "broad adoption" claim.
- **Wave timing: months 4–6.** Not a Wave 1 release. Wave 1 is the four-package "visibility quartet" (`html-min` rebuild, `html-min-laravel`, `html-min-bundle`, `html-min-twig`). The AST library is **extracted from the rebuilt `html-min` engine**, not built standalone — a working in-tree AST proves the design before promotion to a separate package.
- **Adoption ceiling:** 100K–1M installs over 3 years, almost entirely as a transitive dep. Direct end-user adoption will be tiny (most people want a minifier, linter, or formatter — not a parser). Plan around transitive growth.
- **Effort:** large. Comparable scope to `nikic/php-parser` v1 (≈6–12 months solo for a credible v1.0).

### What success looks like at month 12

- v0.1 published on Packagist with semver intent declared (0.x = unstable shape).
- `akankov/html-min` v2 depends on it. (Most important.)
- At least one external dependent: a community-built linter, accessibility checker, or formatter — even a toy one. Solicit one in a Reddit/r/PHP post if it doesn't appear organically.
- Documented round-trip fidelity claim with a fixture corpus.
- Benchmarks against `masterminds/html5` and against `\Dom\HTMLDocument` raw, on a public corpus.

### Why this package exists at all (vs. just shipping `\Dom\HTMLDocument` directly)

`\Dom\HTMLDocument` (PHP 8.4 native) is a great parser but a poor AST for transformation work. Specific gaps:

- No token-position metadata (byte offsets, line/col) — required for linters and source maps.
- Visitor API is shaped for DOM walking, not AST mutation; immutable-ish but with awkward live-NodeList semantics.
- No round-trip printer — serializing back drops trivia (whitespace between attributes, attribute quoting style, CDATA boundary preservation in foreign content).
- No error recovery surfaces — parse errors are silent or thrown; consumers can't introspect the error stream.
- Locked to PHP 8.4+. Many target environments are still 8.3.

`html-ast` wraps and complements `\Dom\HTMLDocument` (and provides a fallback parser for 8.3) while adding the layers that turn it into a real AST library.

---

## 2. Competitive landscape (April–May 2026)

### PHP HTML parsing landscape

| Project | Approach | Maintenance | Gap vs. `html-ast` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `\DOMDocument` (libxml, ext-dom) | HTML4 parser, broken on HTML5 | Bundled | Not spec-compliant; rewrites entities; no AST surface |
| `\Dom\HTMLDocument` (PHP 8.4 core) | Native HTML5, lexbor-based | Bundled (8.4+) | No positions, no printer, no visitor; 8.4-only |
| `masterminds/html5` | Pure-PHP HTML5 parser, MIT | Slowing; last meaningful work 2023 | Has tree, no positions, no printer fidelity, no visitor |
| `voku/simple_html_dom` | Wrapper over `voku/html5parser` | Being phased out (we just removed it from `html-min`) | Not actually an AST; CSS-selector-style traversal |
| `symfony/dom-crawler` | XPath/CSS wrapper around DOMDocument | Active core Symfony | Not an AST; query-only |
| `paquettg/php-html-parser` | Regex/DOM hybrid | Slow, niche | Not spec-compliant |
| `sunra/php-simple-html-dom-parser` | Fork of the original simple_html_dom | Stale | Same as above |

**Conclusion:** there is **no existing PHP library that combines a spec-compliant HTML5 parse, position-preserving tokens, an immutable AST, a visitor framework, and a fidelity printer**. The closest analog (`masterminds/html5`) has the tree but none of the rest.

### Reference implementations to study (cross-language)

These are the prior art the design should learn from, not copy literally:

- **`nikic/PHP-Parser`** (PHP, BSD-3-Clause) — gold standard. Study the visitor API (`NodeVisitor`, `NodeTraverser`), the `enterNode`/`leaveNode` return-value protocol (replace, remove, stop traversal), the printer architecture (`PrettyPrinter\Standard` with formatting-preserving subclass), the `Node\Stmt`/`Node\Expr` hierarchy, and how attributes (positions, comments) are stored.
- **`parse5`** (JS, MIT) — the spec-compliance gold standard for HTML5. WHATWG conformance tests; tree-adapter pattern lets it back multiple AST shapes.
- **`@swc/html`** (Rust, Apache-2.0) — fastest modern HTML parser/AST. Their AST has clean position records and a visit_mut pattern worth borrowing.
- **`html5ever` / `markup5ever`** (Rust, MIT/Apache-2.0; Servo) — most rigorous spec implementation. Tendril-based string handling is a useful pattern even outside Rust.
- **`htmlparser2`** + **`domhandler`** (JS, MIT) — the SAX-with-tree pattern. Useful prior art for the streaming/incremental angle (deferred in this package's v0.1).
- **`prettier/parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter`** — example of how a downstream tool adapts an upstream parser tree to its own needs. Mirrors the relationship `html-min` will have with `html-ast`.

### Naming and namespace claims

- Composer name: `akankov/html-ast`.
- PHP namespace: `Akankov\HtmlAst\`.
- Repo: `github.com/akankov/html-ast` (claim early; the Packagist landgrab risk is low but the GitHub one is real).
- Ship the README header with the "`nikic/php-parser` for HTML" framing on day one. This is a deliberate citation magnet.

---

## 3. Why now (the technical pivot)

PHP 8.4 ships **native, spec-compliant HTML5 parsing** via `\Dom\HTMLDocument` (lexbor under the hood). This is the most important PHP-platform shift for HTML tooling in a decade. Every existing PHP HTML library sits on either:

- `DOMDocument::loadHTML` — libxml's HTML4 parser, which silently rewrites entities, mangles HTML5 elements, defaults to ISO-8859-1, and drops `<svg>` content.
- `masterminds/html5` — pure-PHP HTML5 tokenizer, correct but slow.
- `voku/simple_html_dom` and its descendants — selector-oriented, not parser-oriented.

`\Dom\HTMLDocument` collapses that landscape. A library that builds **on top of** the native parser, not around its limitations, is structurally different from everything that exists today. That is the technical anchor for the criterion-#5 originality claim.

The 12–24 month window: until PHP 8.4 is the floor for serious projects (≈end of 2027), there's an opportunity to be the canonical AST library that bridges 8.3 (via `masterminds/html5` fallback) and 8.4+ (native). After that window, anyone could ship the same package and the namespace race tightens.

---

## 4. Design decisions — DECIDED vs. OPEN

### Decided

- **PHP floor: 8.3.** Same as the rest of the ecosystem. Drop 8.3 only when the rest of `akankov/*` does.
- **License: MIT.** Matches the rest of the ecosystem; permissive is required for transitive-dep adoption.
- **Strict types: `declare(strict_types=1);`** in every file.
- **PHPStan level max + Phan + PHP-CS-Fixer.** Same gates as `html-min`. CI matrix on 8.3 / 8.4 / 8.5.
- **Public API namespace: `Akankov\HtmlAst\`.** Stable contracts under `Akankov\HtmlAst\Contract\` (interfaces). Internals under `Akankov\HtmlAst\Internal\` and excluded from BC guarantees.
- **Versioning: 0.x is unstable; promote to 1.0 only after `html-min` v2 has shipped against a frozen API for ≥2 months.**
- **No runtime dependencies on `voku/*` or `symfony/dom-crawler`.** Those are the legacy stack we're leaving behind.
- **Allowed runtime dependencies (max):** none for the 8.4+ path; `masterminds/html5` only as an optional `suggest` for the 8.3 fallback (NOT a hard `require` — it must be possible to use the library on 8.4 with zero deps).
- **No FFI.** `html-ast` is pure-PHP. The FFI work belongs in `akankov/css-min` (lightningcss bridge), not here.
- **Extracted from `html-min` v2, not designed in isolation.** `html-min` v2's internal AST is the prototype; once it stabilizes, lift it into this package and have `html-min` v3 depend on it.

### Open (require user input or design exploration)

These are the decisions to make during the design phase, before any code is written. Each lists the options and the leaning, but **none are committed**.

#### O1. Parser source

- **(a)** Native `\Dom\HTMLDocument` only; require PHP 8.4. *Pro: zero deps, fastest. Con: cuts off 8.3 users, contradicts ecosystem floor.*
- **(b)** Native on 8.4+, `masterminds/html5` fallback on 8.3. *Pro: matches ecosystem floor, lets us ship now. Con: two parsers to test against, fidelity differences.*
- **(c)** Custom tokenizer + tree-construction (port of `html5ever` algorithms). *Pro: no external dep, full control over positions and error stream. Con: 6+ months of work just for the parser; spec evolves.*

  **Lean: (b)** for v0.1; revisit (c) only if (b) blocks position fidelity. Ship a `Parser` interface with two implementations (`NativeParser`, `MastermindsParser`) and an autoselection factory.

#### O2. AST node shape

- **(a)** Class hierarchy with readonly properties (à la `nikic/php-parser`). Mutation = construct new node + replace via visitor. *Pro: familiar PHP idiom, immutability gives equational reasoning. Con: more verbose mutations.*
- **(b)** Tagged enum + record classes (PHP 8.3 readonly classes, enums for type discriminator). *Pro: pattern-matchable with `match`, smaller surface. Con: less ergonomic, no inheritance for shared behavior.*
- **(c)** Mutable nodes with parent pointers (à la DOM). *Pro: ergonomic mutation. Con: aliasing bugs, hard to do structural sharing, complicates printer.*

  **Lean: (a)** with `public private(set)` (8.4 asymmetric visibility) for internal mutability during construction, then sealed. Use lazy objects (8.4) for deferred subtree materialization on big documents.

#### O3. Position metadata granularity

- **(a)** Byte offset only. *Pro: small, fast. Con: line/col reconstruction is O(n) per query.*
- **(b)** Byte offset + line + column on every node. *Pro: linter/printer friendly. Con: bigger nodes, ≈3× memory.*
- **(c)** Byte offset on nodes + a `SourceMap` side-table mapping offsets to line/col on demand. *Pro: small nodes, line/col available cheaply. Con: extra object to thread through APIs.*

  **Lean: (c).** Matches how `nikic/php-parser` evolved (started with line, gained file position, settled on attribute bag). Required for source-map output later in the ecosystem.

#### O4. Trivia (whitespace/comments) preservation

- **(a)** Discard. *Pro: simplest. Con: no round-trip, no formatter, no minifier source-map.*
- **(b)** Attach trivia to adjacent nodes (leading/trailing). *Pro: round-trip. Con: ambiguous attribution, complex visitor semantics.*
- **(c)** Token stream is a first-class artifact alongside the tree; tree refers to token ranges. *Pro: full fidelity, formatter-friendly. Con: double the data, more API.*

  **Lean: (c).** This is the differentiator vs. `\Dom\HTMLDocument`. Without it the package has no reason to exist as a separate library.

#### O5. Visitor API

- **(a)** Single `visit(Node): Node|null|VisitorAction` returning replacement/null/skip. *Pro: simple. Con: no enter/leave distinction.*
- **(b)** `enterNode` + `leaveNode` (à la `nikic/php-parser`) with sentinel return values for `REMOVE`, `STOP`, `DONT_TRAVERSE_CHILDREN`, `REPLACE_WITH(node)`. *Pro: battle-tested protocol PHP devs already know. Con: copying nikic for the win means we can't differentiate on this axis.*
- **(c)** Reactive/streaming visitor (SAX-style) with start/end element callbacks. *Pro: streaming friendly. Con: doesn't fit the immutable-AST model.*

  **Lean: (b).** Familiarity wins; nikic's protocol is a known good answer. Ship a separate streaming API in v0.3 (option (c)) if/when streaming becomes a real requirement.

#### O6. Printer fidelity contract

- **(a)** Lossy normalizing printer only. *Pro: simple, smallest output. Con: useless for any consumer who needs round-trip.*
- **(b)** Two printers: `StandardPrinter` (normalized) and `LosslessPrinter` (round-trips trivia exactly). *Pro: covers both audiences. Con: two implementations to maintain.*
- **(c)** Single configurable printer with a "preserve trivia" flag. *Pro: one codepath. Con: flag explosion likely.*

  **Lean: (b).** Same pattern as `nikic/php-parser` (`Standard` vs. format-preserving). Lossless is the harder one — implement Standard first, lossless in v0.2.

#### O7. Error model

- **(a)** Throw on first parse error. *Pro: simple. Con: fights HTML5 spec, which mandates recovery.*
- **(b)** Always recover; emit errors to a collector; produce a best-effort tree. *Pro: matches spec. Con: consumers may forget to check the error stream.*
- **(c)** Configurable: strict mode throws, lenient mode recovers. *Pro: both audiences served. Con: two test paths.*

  **Lean: (c)** with default = lenient, since that's what HTML5 mandates. `ParseResult` with `tree`, `errors`, `tokens` — no way to consume the tree without seeing the result envelope.

#### O8. Fragment vs. document parsing

- **(a)** Document only. *Pro: simple. Con: useless for templates, components, SSE chunks.*
- **(b)** Document and fragment APIs from day one, with insertion-mode parameter for fragments. *Pro: matches HTML5 spec. Con: more API surface in v0.1.*

  **Lean: (b).** Required for `html-min`'s streaming/fragment work. Ship in v0.1.

#### O9. Streaming/incremental parsing

- v0.1: **out of scope.** Document and fragment, all-at-once.
- v0.2: revisit if `html-min` v2 needs it for SSE/Turbo Streams.

#### O10. Naming the AST node types

The HTML5 spec calls them "elements", "text nodes", "comment nodes", etc. Two camps:

- **(a)** Spec names: `Element`, `Text`, `Comment`, `Doctype`, `ProcessingInstruction`, `CDataSection`, `Document`, `DocumentFragment`. *Pro: matches spec, matches `\Dom\HTMLDocument`. Con: "Element" is overloaded in PHP-land.*
- **(b)** Disambiguated names: `HtmlElement`, `HtmlText`, etc. *Pro: explicit. Con: noise.*

  **Lean: (a)** scoped under `Akankov\HtmlAst\Node\` so the namespace disambiguates.

## 6. Sequencing and milestones

### Prerequisite: `html-min` v2

`html-ast` is **extracted from**, not designed independently of, `html-min` v2. Order:

1. **`html-min` v2** rebuilds the engine on `\Dom\HTMLDocument` with an in-tree AST under `Akankov\HtmlMin\Internal\Ast\` — months 0–2 of the ecosystem timeline (Wave 1).
2. While building v2, treat the in-tree AST as the **prototype** for `html-ast`. Every observer / transformation we write against it informs the API.
3. Once v2 ships and lives a few weeks, **lift the AST out** into `akankov/html-ast`, polish the API based on what v2 actually needed, freeze v0.1 contracts.
4. `html-min` v3 (point release) drops the in-tree AST and depends on `akankov/html-ast`.

This sequencing avoids the worst failure mode: designing an AST library in a vacuum and discovering its ergonomics are wrong only when the first real consumer tries to use it.

### Milestones (from the start of dedicated `html-ast` work — i.e. month 4 of the ecosystem timeline)

- **M0 (week 0):** API design doc — resolve all O1–O10 open questions. Output: `docs/design/api-v0.1.md`.
- **M1 (weeks 1–2):** Parser interface + `NativeParser` (8.4 path) + `ParseResult` + token stream. No visitor or printer yet. Round-trip token-stream → string for fidelity baseline.
- **M2 (weeks 3–4):** AST node hierarchy + tree construction from token stream. Visitor interface + `NodeTraverser`. Replace `html-min` v2's internal AST with this package (private `dev-master` link via path repo, same trick the `benchmarks/` project uses).
- **M3 (weeks 5–6):** `StandardPrinter`. Integration test: `html-min` v2 builds against `html-ast` with no functional regressions on the existing fixture corpus.
- **M4 (weeks 6–7):** `MastermindsParser` for 8.3 fallback. Position-fidelity reconciliation between the two backends (document any divergences explicitly).
- **M5 (week 8):** v0.1.0 tag, Packagist publish, README, badge, two README examples (visitor: strip `data-testid` attributes; printer: roundtrip a fragment).
- **Post-v0.1:** marketing pulse — `r/PHP`, Hacker News Show HN, Laravel News pitch, php[architect] commission proposal. (Per ecosystem strategy section 3.5.)

### Out of scope for v0.1

- Lossless printer (deferred to v0.2).
- Streaming/incremental parser (deferred to v0.3).
- Source-map emission as a top-level feature (the `Position\SourceMap` table exists but no `.map` JSON writer yet).
- Linter framework, accessibility checker, formatter — these are downstream packages, not part of `html-ast`.

## 7. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `\Dom\HTMLDocument` API changes between PHP 8.4 and 8.5 | medium | high | Pin behavior tests against both 8.4 and 8.5 in CI from day one. Subscribe to php-internals threads on `Dom\*` changes. |
| `masterminds/html5` becomes fully unmaintained mid-development | medium | medium | Keep the `MastermindsParser` adapter thin; if upstream dies, vendor-in or drop the 8.3 fallback. |
| Designing the visitor API in a vacuum produces ergonomic mistakes | high if rushed | high | Prerequisite of building `html-min` v2 first specifically guards against this. Do not skip step 1. |
| Naming collision with another `*/html-ast` package | low | medium | Claim Packagist + GitHub names early, even before publishing. |
| Solo-maintainer credibility ceiling (per ecosystem strategy section 6.5) | high | high | Recruit at least one contributor before v0.2 ships. Tag good-first-issues from M2 onward. Document the contribution flow (`make dev`) before the v0.1 release. |
| Performance regression vs. raw `\Dom\HTMLDocument` is too large to justify the wrapper | medium | high | Set explicit budget at the design phase: ≤2× parse time, ≤3× memory. Benchmark continuously from M1. If the budget can't be met for the AST construction layer, lazy-construct nodes (PHP 8.4 lazy objects). |
| Spec drift in HTML5 / DOM specs requires AST changes that break consumers | low/medium | medium | 0.x semver explicitly tells consumers shape changes are expected. Promote to 1.0 only after spec velocity slows or the API has been frozen ≥2 months in production. |
| BC accident in `html-min` v2 → v3 transition (when v3 starts depending on `html-ast`) | medium | medium | Make `html-min` v3 a dependency-only change (no public API change); cut a v2.1 first that internally uses `html-ast` behind a feature flag. |

## 8. License heritage and porting notes

For any algorithm we port from prior art:

| Source | License | Permission level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nikic/php-parser` | BSD-3-Clause | Direct port permitted with attribution. |
| `parse5` | MIT | Direct port permitted. |
| `@swc/html` | Apache-2.0 | Direct port permitted; preserve `NOTICE`. |
| `html5ever` / `markup5ever` | MIT/Apache-2.0 | Direct port permitted. |
| `masterminds/html5` | MIT | Direct port permitted (but we wrap, not port). |
| Lexbor (the engine inside `\Dom\HTMLDocument`) | Apache-2.0 | We don't port — we use through PHP 8.4's binding. |

Maintain a `CREDITS.md` documenting the lineage of any non-trivial algorithm. Per ecosystem strategy section 6.4, this doubles as soft "original contribution" evidence by making the comparison concrete (showing exactly what is novel and what is rewritten).

---

## 9. Checklist before any code is written

- [ ] All open questions in section 4 (O1–O10) resolved with a written rationale.
- [ ] Parser interface signature agreed (input type, options, return envelope).
- [ ] Node hierarchy diagram approved.
- [ ] Visitor return-value protocol agreed (sentinel enum vs. nullable node).
- [ ] Performance budget written (≤2× parse, ≤3× memory vs. raw `\Dom\HTMLDocument`).
- [ ] CI matrix decided (PHP 8.3 / 8.4 / 8.5; with and without `masterminds/html5`).
- [ ] Repo claimed on GitHub + name reserved on Packagist.
- [ ] `html-min` v2 has shipped and the in-tree AST has lived through ≥2 weeks of real use.

Only when **all** of those are checked do we move from this plan to a `writing-plans`-style implementation plan and start writing code.

---

## 10. Open questions for the operator

These are the questions to resolve next, before the design phase starts:

1. Confirm that `html-ast` is genuinely blocked on `html-min` v2 (i.e., we accept the "extract, don't design in isolation" sequencing). If you want to start `html-ast` independently, that changes the risk profile in section 7 substantially.
2. Confirm the PHP 8.3 floor. Dropping 8.3 (going 8.4-only) eliminates the `masterminds/html5` adapter, halves the testing matrix, and gives the package a "modern PHP only" marketing angle — but cuts off shared-hosting users who are still on 8.3.
3. Confirm willingness to recruit a contributor before v0.2. This is the single biggest non-technical risk per ecosystem strategy section 6.5.
4. Decide whether the `akankov/html-ast` repo lives in this workspace alongside `html-min` and `twig-compress-html`, or in a separate top-level workspace.

When those are answered, the next step is the design-decision phase (resolving O1–O10), then a `writing-plans`-flavored implementation plan, then code.
